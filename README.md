Be warned, the game balance remains a WIP
Using the "export" feature every now and then is highly recommended, even on main release, since there's always a risk of some gamebreaking bugs having made it through the testing undetected

##### Running
To run the project locally, you will need a server - even some basic static server will be enough, as it's only about CORS policy. Npm module 'live-server' works perfectly for this purpose https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server

##### Modifying/Modding
Making actual changes in code will require either running the build script after installing esbuild, or simply changing script source in index.html from dist/bundle.js to src/main.js

For modding purposes, it's recommended to at the very least take a look at the dev repository, as there's always a possibility it already contains things you wanted to add, or has code changes that will make your work easier, or at least has a fix to a bug you found
